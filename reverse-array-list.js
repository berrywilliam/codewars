//Arrays
//Your pokemon party order which is a list of pokemon has been leaked to Misty. Please create a function that reverses your list and prints it to the console. 

// My Solution : 

function poke(partyList){
    console.log (partyList.reverse())
}
poke(['hey', 'why', 'so', 'serious')  //["serious", "so", "why", "hey"]
